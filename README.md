    25 lines per function max
    In this case only array are allowed no list are allowed
    also new restriction variable declaration of the function must be on the top of the function
    No more than 5 functions per file
    In most of the exercice only 1 file is allowed
    every allocation or system call must  be checked
    code should compile with theses flag -Wall -Wpedantic -Werror
    If you do allocation check with valgrind if there is no memory leaks `valgrind ./a.out`
